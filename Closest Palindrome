Given a number num, our task is to find the closest Palindrome number whose absolute difference with given number is minimum. If 2 Palindome numbers have same absolute difference from the given number, then find the smaller one.
 

Example 1:

Input: num = 9
Output: 9
Explanation: 9 itself is a palindrome
number.

def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

def closest_palindrome(num):
    if num < 0:
        return 0  # Handle negative numbers by returning 0.

    num_str = str(num)

    # Check if the given number is already a palindrome.
    if is_palindrome(num_str):
        return num

    n = len(num_str)

    # Check two possible candidates: smaller and larger palindromes.
    smaller_candidate = int(str(num - 1))
    larger_candidate = int(str(num + 1))

    # Calculate the absolute differences from the given number.
    diff_smaller = abs(num - smaller_candidate)
    diff_larger = abs(larger_candidate - num)

    # If both candidates have the same absolute difference, choose the smaller one.
    if diff_smaller == diff_larger:
        return smaller_candidate if smaller_candidate < num else larger_candidate

    # Return the candidate with the smaller absolute difference.
    return smaller_candidate if diff_smaller < diff_larger else larger_candidate

# Example usage:
num = 9
result = closest_palindrome(num)
print(result)  # Output: 9
